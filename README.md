# Monitoring and Detection: Splunk

## Objective

The objective of this lab was to practice using Splunk to monitor a web application and detect potential malicious activity. In this lab, I learned how to upload data, perform searches using Splunk Processing Language (SPL), create reports, and set up alerts in Splunk to monitor and detect threats in a network.

### Skills Learned

- Uploading and indexing data in Splunk.
- Performing keyword and field-based searches using Splunk Processing Language (SPL).
- Creating and sharing reports.
- Visualizing data with charts and graphs.
- Building dashboards for data analysis.
- Setting up alerts to monitor specific events

### Tools Used

- Splunk Enterprise.
